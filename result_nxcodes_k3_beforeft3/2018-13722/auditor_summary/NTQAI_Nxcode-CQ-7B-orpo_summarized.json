            "reason": "The function `safeMul` multiplies two unsigned integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is 0, the result is always 0. If `a` is not 0, the result is `a * b`. However, the assertion `c / a == b` checks if the division of `c` by `a` equals `b`. If `a` is 0, this assertion will always hold true, which is not the case. This can lead to an integer overflow if `b` is very large. The correct assertion should be `c / a == b || b == 0`, which ensures that if `b` is 0, the result is 0, and if `b` is not 0, the result is `a * b`.

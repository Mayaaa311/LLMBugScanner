Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "balanceOf",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The balanceOf function does not check for integer overflow when calculating the balance of an address. This could lead to incorrect balance calculations and potentially loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check for integer overflow when updating the balances of the sender and receiver. This could lead to incorrect balance calculations and potentially loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check for integer overflow when updating the balances of the sender, receiver, and spender. This could lead to incorrect balance calculations and potentially loss of funds.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

As per the severity level, all three vulnerabilities have the same severity level of 8. However, the output is sorted based on the severity level in ascending order.

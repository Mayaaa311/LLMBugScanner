The criticisms for each vulnerability are comprehensive and detailed. The correctness, severity, and profitability scores are also provided, ranging from 0 to 9. The scores are based on the likelihood of the vulnerability causing a loss, the severity of the vulnerability, and the profitability of the vulnerability, respectively.

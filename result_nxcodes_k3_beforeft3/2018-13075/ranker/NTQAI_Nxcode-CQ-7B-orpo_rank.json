Here is the output in JSON format:

        {
            "function_name": "setMinBalance",
            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "criticism": "The function name 'setMinBalance' is misspelled as 'setMinBalance'. This typo could lead to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 5,
            "profitability": 1
        },
        {
            "function_name": "setTokenName",
            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "criticism": "The function name 'setTokenName' is misspelled as 'setTokenName'. This typo could lead to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 5,
            "profitability": 1
        },
        {
            "function_name": "setTokenSymbol",
            "vulnerability": "Typo Constructor",
            "criticism": "The function name 'setTokenSymbol' is misspelled as 'setTokenSymbol'. This typo could lead to confusion and potential security vulnerabilities.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 5,
            "profitability": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

As per the severity level, all three vulnerabilities have the same severity of 5. However, since the requirement is to output the top 3 most severe vulnerabilities, all three vulnerabilities are included in the output.

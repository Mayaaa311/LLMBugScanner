In the above output, I have rated the correctness, severity, and profitability of each vulnerability based on the given scoring system. The correctness score ranges from 0 to 9, where 7 is considered a good score. The severity score ranges from 0 to 9, where 8 is considered a high severity. The profitability score ranges from 0 to 9, where 6 is considered a moderate profitability. The criticisms provide explanations for the scoring.

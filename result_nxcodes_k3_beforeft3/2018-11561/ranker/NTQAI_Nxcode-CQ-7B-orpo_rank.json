      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "In the ERC20Token constructor, the totalSupply is set to 12 * 10 ** 24. However, this value is not checked for overflow before being assigned to the totalSupply variable. This could lead to a situation where the totalSupply becomes too large, which is not allowed in this ERC20 token contract. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a token with an excessive supply.",

      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The distributeToken function decreases the sender's balance by _value before transferring it to the specified addresses. However, it does not check for overflow before the transfer. This could lead to a situation where the sender's balance becomes negative, which is not allowed in this ERC20 token contract.

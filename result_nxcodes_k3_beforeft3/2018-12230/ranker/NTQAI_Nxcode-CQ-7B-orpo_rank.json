Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check if the sum of the sender's balance and the transfer amount exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the transfer amount is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable, resulting in an incorrect balance for the sender and the recipient.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check if the sum of the sender's balance and the transfer amount exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the transfer amount is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable, resulting in an incorrect balance for the sender and the recipient.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function does not check if the sum of the total supply and the minted amount exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the minted amount is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable, resulting in an incorrect total supply.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is already in JSON format and it contains all the vulnerabilities sorted by severity.

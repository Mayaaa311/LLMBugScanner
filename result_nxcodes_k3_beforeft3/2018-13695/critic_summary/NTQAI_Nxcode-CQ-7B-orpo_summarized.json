If `tokenAmount` is not equal to `amount`, `amount` is not equal to 0, or `receiver` is not equal to `msg.sender`, the function reverts. The `totalSupply` is increased by `amount*1 ether`. The `balances` mapping is updated with `amount*1 ether`. The `Transfer` event is emitted. However, the `totalSupply` is not checked for overflow. If `amount` is too large, it can cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to mint more tokens than intended.",

The `totalSupply` is then checked for overflow. If `totalSupply` is greater than 999999, the function reverts. The `rate` is set based on the `totalSupply`. The `tokenAmount` is calculated based on the `msg.value` and `rate`. If `tokenAmount` is less than 0, the function reverts. The `check` variable is used to prevent integer overflow.

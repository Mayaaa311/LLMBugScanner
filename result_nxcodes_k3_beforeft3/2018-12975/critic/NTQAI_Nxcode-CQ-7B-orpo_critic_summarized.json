Explanation:
The correctness score is calculated as the percentage of the vulnerability description that is accurate and relevant to the function. In this case, the vulnerability description is accurate and relevant to the function, so the correctness score is 100%.
The severity score is calculated as the percentage of the vulnerability description that is accurate and relevant to the function. In this case, the vulnerability description is accurate and relevant to the function, so the severity score is 100%.
The profitability score is calculated as the percentage of the vulnerability description that is accurate and relevant to the function. In this case, the vulnerability description is accurate and relevant to the function, so the profitability score is 100%.

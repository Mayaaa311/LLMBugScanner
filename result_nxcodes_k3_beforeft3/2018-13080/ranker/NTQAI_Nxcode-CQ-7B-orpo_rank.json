Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transfer function does not check for integer overflow when adding the transferred amount to the recipient's balance. This could lead to an overflow if the recipient's balance exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This could be exploited by an attacker to steal tokens from the recipient.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The transferFrom function does not check for integer overflow when adding the transferred amount to the recipient's balance.

      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintToken function does not check for integer overflow when adding the minted amount to the target's balance. This could lead to an overflow if the target's balance exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This could be exploited by an attacker to steal tokens from the target.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is already in JSON format and it contains all the vulnerabilities sorted by severity.

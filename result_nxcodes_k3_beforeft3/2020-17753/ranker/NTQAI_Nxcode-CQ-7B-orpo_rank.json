Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import json

# Input JSON
input_json = '["{"output_list": ["function_name": "buyFromRC","vulnerability": "Integer Overflow","criticism": "The buyFromRC function has an integer overflow vulnerability. The remainingTokens variable is not checked for overflow before being used in the calculation of tokenAmount. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of tokenAmount and potentially result in a loss of funds.","correctness": 7,"severity": 8,"profitability": 5}"]'

# Convert the input string to a list of dictionaries
data = json.loads(input_json)

# Convert the list of dictionaries to a list of dictionaries with the 'severity' key
severity_list = [d[0] for d in data]

# Sort the list of dictionaries by the 'severity' key in descending order
severity_list.sort(key=lambda x: x['severity'], reverse=True)

# Output the top 3 most severe vulnerabilities in a JSON format
output_json = json.dumps(severity_list[:3])
print(output_json)
```

This code first converts the input string to a list of dictionaries. Then, it extracts the 'severity' key from each dictionary and sorts the list of dictionaries by the 'severity' key in descending order. Finally, it outputs the top 3 most severe vulnerabilities in a JSON format.

Explanation:
The contract has an integer overflow vulnerability in the if condition. The value of entry_number is incremented by 1 in each transaction, but it is not checked whether it exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can lead to an overflow, which can result in incorrect results and potentially loss of funds. The correctness score is 7, severity score is 9, and profitability score is 5.

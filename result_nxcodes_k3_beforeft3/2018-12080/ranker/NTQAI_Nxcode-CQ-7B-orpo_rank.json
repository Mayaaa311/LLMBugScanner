Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "INTToken",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function INTToken has a parameter initialSupply which is of type uint256. This means that the maximum value that can be passed to this parameter is 2^256 - 1. However, the function does not check if the passed value exceeds this maximum value. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the value of initialSupply is increased beyond its maximum value. This could potentially result in the loss of tokens or other assets.",
      "correctness": 9,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output only contains the single vulnerability with the highest severity, which is the Integer Overflow vulnerability in the INTToken function.

      "criticism": "The function `_transfer` has an integer overflow vulnerability. The line `balanceOf[_to] += _value;` can cause an integer overflow if the balance of `_to` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can be exploited by sending a large amount of tokens to the contract, causing the contract's balance to exceed the maximum value. This can be mitigated by using SafeMath library functions to perform arithmetic operations.",

This can be exploited by an attacker who locks the contract and then calls `uploadBalances` to transfer tokens to themselves, effectively stealing the tokens from the contract owner. This can be mitigated by adding a modifier to check if the contract is locked before updating the balances.",

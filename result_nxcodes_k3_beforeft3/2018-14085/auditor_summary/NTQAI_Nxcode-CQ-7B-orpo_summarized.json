However, the function does not check if the `amount` is within the range of the `uint` type. If the `amount` is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint`, it will cause an integer overflow. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially loss of funds. The function should add a check to ensure that the `amount` is within the valid range before performing the transfer."

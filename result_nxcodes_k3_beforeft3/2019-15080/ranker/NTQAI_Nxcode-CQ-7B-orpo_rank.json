      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The mintTokens function does not check if the addition of the minted amount and the current total supply exceeds the maximum safe integer value for uint256. This could lead to an integer overflow, where the minted amount is greater than the maximum safe integer value, resulting in an incorrect total supply and an incorrect balance for the contract owner.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,

    }
  ]
}
```

As per the severity level, all three vulnerabilities have the same severity level of 8. Therefore, the output will be the same as the input.

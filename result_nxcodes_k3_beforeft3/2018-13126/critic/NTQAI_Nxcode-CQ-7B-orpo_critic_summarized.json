In the `mint` function, the total supply of tokens is increased by `_value`, which can cause an overflow if `_value` is greater than the maximum limit `TOKEN_LIMIT`. This vulnerability can be mitigated by adding a check to ensure that the total supply does not exceed the maximum limit before increasing it.

In the `buyTokens` function, the number of tokens bought is calculated by dividing the input value by the price per token. If the input value is greater than the maximum limit `TOKEN_LIMIT`, this can cause an overflow. This vulnerability can be mitigated by adding a check to ensure that the input value does not exceed the maximum limit before calculating the number of tokens bought.

Both vulnerabilities have a high severity level (8) and a moderate profitability level (5). The correctness level is also high (7) as the vulnerability can be mitigated by adding appropriate checks.

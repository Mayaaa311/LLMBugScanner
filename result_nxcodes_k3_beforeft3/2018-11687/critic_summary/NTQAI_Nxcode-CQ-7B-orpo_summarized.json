However, the _totalSupply variable is initialized with a value of 21000000 * 10^8, which is greater than the maximum value that can be held by a uint256. This means that the totalSupply variable will overflow and become zero, causing the contract to return an incorrect total supply value.",

However, if the owner's balance is less than 2000 * 10^8, this operation will cause an integer overflow and result in the owner's balance being set to zero. This will also cause the balances of the addresses in the addresses array to be increased by 2000 * 10^8, which is not intended. To fix this vulnerability, the function should subtract 2000 * 10^8 from the owner's balance before performing the transfer operation.",

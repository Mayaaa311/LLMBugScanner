Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "convertPresaleTokens",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `convertPresaleTokens` is vulnerable to integer overflow. The variable `tokensSold` is incremented by `tokens` in each call, but there is no check to ensure that the addition does not exceed the maximum value of `uint256`. This could lead to an incorrect value of `tokensSold` and potentially allow for a larger number of tokens to be sold than intended.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "buyTokens",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `buyTokens` is also vulnerable to integer overflow. Similar to `convertPresaleTokens`, the variable `tokensSold` is incremented by `tokens` in each call, but there is no check to ensure that the addition does not exceed the maximum value of `uint256`. This could lead to an incorrect value of `tokensSold` and potentially allow for a larger number of tokens to be sold than intended.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "creditJackpotTokens",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `creditJackpotTokens` is also vulnerable to integer overflow. Similar to `convertPresaleTokens` and `buyTokens`, the variable `tokensSold` is incremented by `tokens` in each call, but there is no check to ensure that the addition does not exceed the maximum value of `uint256`.

      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 7,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is already in JSON format and it contains all the vulnerabilities sorted by severity.

      "function_name": "setBettingCondition",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `setBettingCondition` takes two parameters `_contenders` and `_bettingprice`. The assignment `arraysize  = _contenders;` can cause an integer overflow if `_contenders` is greater than 1000. This can be exploited by sending a large value of `_contenders` to the contract. The vulnerability can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that `_contenders` is less than or equal to 1000.",

      "severity": 7,

    },

      "function_name": "addguess",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function `addguess` is called when a user sends a transaction to the contract. The assignment `numguesses++` can cause an integer overflow if `numguesses` is greater than or equal to 1000. This can be exploited by sending a large number of transactions to the contract. The vulnerability can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that `numguesses` is less than or equal to 1000.",

The assignment `arraysize  = _contenders;` can cause an integer overflow if `_contenders` is greater than 1000. This can be exploited by sending a large value of `_contenders` to the contract. The vulnerability can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that `_contenders` is less than or equal to 1000."

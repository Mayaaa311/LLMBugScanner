The input JSON contains a list of vulnerabilities in a smart contract. The vulnerability "Integer Overflow" is listed multiple times, and it is the most severe vulnerability. The totalSupply function is declared as constant, but it is not marked as view, which can lead to integer overflow if the totalSupply is too large. The totalSupply is initialized to a large number, which means that the totalSupply can be manipulated by anyone, even if the contract is not in a safe state. This can lead to integer overflow if the totalSupply is too large. The totalSupply is declared as a uint256, which can hold values up to 2^256 - 1. If the totalSupply is larger than this, it will cause an overflow.

The output JSON should contain the top 3 most severe vulnerabilities in the following format:

```json
{
  "top_vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "severity": "High"
    },
    {
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "severity": "High"
    },
    {
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "severity": "High"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the severity level for the "Integer Overflow" vulnerability is "High" because it is the most severe vulnerability in the list.

The correctness score is calculated as follows:
- 7 for the transfer function because it checks the sum of the sender's balance and the transfer amount against the maximum possible value for a uint256.
- 7 for the transferFrom function because it checks the sum of the sender's allowance and the transfer amount against the maximum possible value for a uint256.
- 7 for the MalaysianCoin constructor because it initializes the total supply of tokens to a value that exceeds the maximum possible value for a uint256.
The severity score is calculated as follows:
- 8 for the transfer function because it could lead to an integer overflow, where the transfer amount is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256.
- 8 for the transferFrom function because it could lead to an integer overflow, where the transfer amount is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256.
- 8 for the MalaysianCoin constructor because it could lead to an integer overflow, where the total supply is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256.
The profitability score is calculated as follows:
- 5 for the transfer function because it could be exploited by an attacker to transfer an amount greater than the maximum possible value, causing the contract to lose all its tokens.
- 5 for the transferFrom function because it could be exploited by an attacker to transfer an amount greater than the maximum possible value, causing the contract to lose all its tokens.
- 5 for the MalaysianCoin constructor because it could be exploited by an attacker to transfer an amount greater than the maximum possible value, causing the contract to lose all its tokens.

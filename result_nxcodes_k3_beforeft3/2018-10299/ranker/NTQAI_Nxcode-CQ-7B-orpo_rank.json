Here is the output in JSON format:

If the balance of the sender is greater than the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256, the transfer operation will fail and the transaction will revert. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a large amount of tokens to a contract that does not have enough balance to receive the tokens.

  ]
}
```

As per the severity level, all three vulnerabilities have the same severity level of 8. However, since the correctness, profitability, and criticism fields are also included, it is possible to sort these vulnerabilities based on these fields as well.

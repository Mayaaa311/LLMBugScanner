Explanation:
1. For the "distributeFUD" function, the vulnerability is rated as 8 (severity) and 5 (profitability) because the vulnerability itself is a high-severity issue, but it is not profitable to fix it because it only affects the contract owner's balance. The correctness is rated as 7 because the function is not completely correct, but it is still a significant vulnerability.
2. For the "balanceOf" function, the vulnerability is rated as 7 (severity) and 4 (profitability) because the vulnerability itself is a high-severity issue, but it is not profitable to fix it because it only affects the contract owner's balance. The correctness is rated as 6 because the function is not completely correct, but it is still a significant vulnerability.
3. For the "getEthBalance" function, the vulnerability is rated as 7 (severity) and 4 (profitability) because the vulnerability itself is a high-severity issue, but it is not profitable to fix it because it only affects the contract owner's balance. The correctness is rated as 6 because the function is not completely correct, but it is still a significant vulnerability.

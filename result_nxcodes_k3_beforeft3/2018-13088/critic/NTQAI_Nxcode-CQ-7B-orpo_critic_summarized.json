Explanation:
The correctness score is calculated by analyzing the code and reasoning. The code is well-written and follows the ERC20 standard. The reasoning is clear and concise. The vulnerability is related to integer overflow, which is a common security issue in blockchain systems. The severity score is 8, indicating a high level of risk. The profitability score is 5, indicating a moderate profitability.

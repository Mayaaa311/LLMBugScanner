In the output, I have provided a detailed criticism for each vulnerability. The correctness score is based on the likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited, the severity score is based on the impact of the vulnerability, and the profitability score is based on the potential profit from exploiting the vulnerability. The scores range from 0 to 9, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest.

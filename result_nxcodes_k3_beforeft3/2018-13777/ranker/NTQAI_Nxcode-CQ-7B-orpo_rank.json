Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "TokenERC20",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The initialSupply is multiplied by 10 ** uint256(decimals) which can cause an integer overflow if the initialSupply is too large. This can lead to the totalSupply being larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the totalSupply variable, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly or fail.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "_transfer",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The balanceOf[_from] -= _value; line can cause an integer overflow if the balanceOf[_from] is too large. This can lead to the balanceOf[_from] being larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the balanceOf variable, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly or fail.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    },
    {
      "function_name": "mintToken",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The totalSupply += mintedAmount; line can cause an integer overflow if the totalSupply is too large. This can lead to the totalSupply being larger than the maximum value that can be stored in the totalSupply variable, which can cause the contract to behave unexpectedly or fail.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 8,
      "profitability": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is already in JSON format and it contains all the vulnerabilities sorted by severity.

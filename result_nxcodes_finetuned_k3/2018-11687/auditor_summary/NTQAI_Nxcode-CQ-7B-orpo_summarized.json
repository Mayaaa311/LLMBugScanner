            "reason": "The function distributeBTR is intended to distribute tokens to a list of addresses. However, it does not use any randomness in the distribution process. This makes the distribution predictable and unfair for the addresses. An attacker can predict the distribution and steal tokens from the addresses. The function should use a randomness source to distribute tokens to the addresses."

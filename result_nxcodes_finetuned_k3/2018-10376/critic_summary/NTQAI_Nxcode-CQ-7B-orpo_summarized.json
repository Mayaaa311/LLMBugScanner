This could lead to token devalue, as the total supply of tokens will be more than the initial supply. The function should also check if the balances of the addresses to receive tokens will exceed the maximum balance. If the total supply or the balance of the addresses to receive tokens exceed the maximum supply or balance, the function should revert.",

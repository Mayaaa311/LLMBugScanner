            "reason": "The transfer function allows the transfer of all tokens from the sender to the receiver. However, the transfer function does not check if the sender has enough tokens to transfer. If the sender has less tokens than the amount to be transferred, the transfer will still be successful, but the tokens will be transferred from the sender to the receiver, which is not the intended behavior. This vulnerability can be exploited to devalue the token."

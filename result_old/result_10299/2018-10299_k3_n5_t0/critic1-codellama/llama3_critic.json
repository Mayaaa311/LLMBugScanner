            "function_name": "transfer",
            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The reasoning provided is incorrect. The use of SafeMath library does prevent integer overflows. Additionally, the vulnerability score should be 0 as it's not possible to exploit an integer overflow in this function.",
            "correctness": 9,
            "severity": 0,
            "profitability": 0
        },

            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "criticism": "The reasoning provided is incorrect. The use of SafeMath library does prevent integer overflows. Additionally, the vulnerability score should be 0 as it's not possible to exploit an integer overflow in this function.",

            "severity": 0,
            "profitability": 0
        }
    ]
}

Note: The correctness, severity, and profitability scores are all 9 because the reasoning provided is incorrect, and there is no actual vulnerability present in these functions.

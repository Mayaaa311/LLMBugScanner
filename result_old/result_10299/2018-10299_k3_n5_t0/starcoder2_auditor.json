1. The function transferFrom() does not check if the token owner has enough tokens to transfer. This can lead to a situation where an attacker transfers all of the tokens from the victim and then calls transferFrom() with a large amount, draining all of the tokens from the contract.
2. The function batchTransfer() allows anyone to call it without any restriction. This means that anyone can drain all of the tokens from the contract by calling this function.
3. The function balanceOf() does not check if the address is valid or not. This means that an attacker can call this function with a random address and get the balance of the token in the contract.

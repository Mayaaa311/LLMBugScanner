1. The `_transfer` function in the `EAI_TokenERC20` contract does not check if the recipient address is a contract address. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the recipient address is a contract that does not implement the `transfer` function. To fix this vulnerability, the `_transfer` function should be modified to check if the recipient address is a contract address and call the `transfer` function if it is. Here is an example of how to modify the `_transfer` function:\\n\n```\nfunction _transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) internal {\n    require(_to!= 0x0);\n    require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value);\n    require(balanceOf[_to] + _value >= balanceOf[_to]);\n    uint previousBalances = balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to];\n    balanceOf[_from] -= _value;\n    balanceOf[_to] += _value;\n    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);\n    assert(balanceOf[_from] + balanceOf[_to] == previousBalances);\n    if (isContract(_to)) {\n        IERC20Receiver receiver = IERC20Receiver(_to);\n        receiver.transfer(msg.sender, _value);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. The `transferFrom` function in the `EAI_TokenERC20` contract does not check if the sender has sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the sender does not have sufficient allowance. To fix this vulnerability, the `transferFrom` function should be modified to check if the sender has sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount. Here is an example of how to modify the `transferFrom` function:\\n\n```\nfunction transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n    require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender]);     \n    allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;\n    _transfer(_from, _to, _value);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n3. The `burn` function in the `EAI_TokenERC20` contract does not check if the sender has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the sender does not have sufficient balance. To fix this vulnerability, the `burn` function should be modified to check if the sender has sufficient balance to burn the specified amount. Here is an example of how to modify the `burn` function:\\n\n```\nfunction burn(uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);   \n    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;            \n    totalSupply -= _value;                      \n    emit Burn(msg.sender, _value);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n4.

Here is an example of how to modify the `EAI_TokenERC20` contract:\\n\n```\nfunction isContract(address _addr) internal returns (bool isContract) {\n    uint32 size;\n    assembly {\n        size := extcodesize(_addr)\n    }\n    return (size > 0);\n}\n```\n\n6.

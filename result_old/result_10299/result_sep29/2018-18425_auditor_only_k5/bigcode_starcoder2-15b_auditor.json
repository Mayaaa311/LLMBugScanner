1. The function getTokens() is payable and canDistr modifier is used. The modifier canDistr checks if the distribution is finished. If the distribution is finished, the modifier will stop the execution of the function. However, the modifier canDistr is not used in the function getTokens(). Therefore, the function getTokens() can be called after the distribution is finished. The attacker can call the function getTokens() to get tokens after the distribution is finished.

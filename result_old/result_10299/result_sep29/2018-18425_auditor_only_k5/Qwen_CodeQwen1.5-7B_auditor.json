1. The function `getTokens()` in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `msg.value` is used to calculate the number of tokens to be distributed, but the `distr()` function is called without checking if the contract has enough tokens to distribute. This allows an attacker to call the `getTokens()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `distr()` function should be modified to check if the contract has enough tokens to distribute before calling it. Here is the modified `getTokens()` function:\n\n```\nfunction getTokens() payable canDistr  public {\n    uint256 tokens = 0;\n    require( msg.value >= minContribution );\n    require( msg.value > 0 );\n    tokens = tokensPerEth.mul(msg.value) / 1 ether;        \n    address investor = msg.sender;\n    if (tokens > 0) {\n        require(totalDistributed.add(tokens) <= totalSupply);\n        distr(investor, tokens);\n    }\n    if (totalDistributed >= totalSupply) {\n        distributionFinished = true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. The `transfer()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `balances[msg.sender]` is used to check if the sender has enough tokens to transfer, but the `balances[_to]` is not updated until after the transfer is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `transfer()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `balances[_to]` should be updated before the transfer is complete. Here is the modified `transfer()` function:\n\n```\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) public returns (bool success) {\n    require(_to!= address(0));\n    require(_amount <= balances[msg.sender]);\n    balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount);\n    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);\n    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _amount);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n3. The `transferFrom()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `balances[_from]` is used to check if the sender has enough tokens to transfer, but the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is not updated until after the transfer is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `transferFrom()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` should be updated before the transfer is complete. Here is the modified `transferFrom()` function:\n\n```\nfunction transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) public returns (bool success) {\n    require(_to!= address(0));\n    require(_amount <= balances[_from]);\n    require(_amount <= allowed[_from][msg.sender]);\n    balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_amount);\n    allowed[_from][msg.sender] = allowed[_from][msg.sender].sub(_amount);\n    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);\n    emit Transfer(_from, _to, _amount);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n4. The `approve()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` is used to check if the sender has enough tokens to approve, but the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is not updated until after the approval is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `approve()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `allowed[_from][msg.sender]` should be updated before the approval is complete. Here is the modified `approve()` function:\n\n```\nfunction approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {\n    if (_value!= 0 && allowed[msg.sender][_spender]!= 0) { return false; }\n    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;\n    emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n5. The `getTokenBalance()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `balances[_owner]` is used to check if the owner has enough tokens to transfer, but the `balances[_to]` is not updated until after the transfer is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `getTokenBalance()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `balances[_to]` should be updated before the transfer is complete. Here is the modified `getTokenBalance()` function:\n\n```\nfunction getTokenBalance(address tokenAddress, address who) constant public returns (uint){\n    AltcoinToken t = AltcoinToken(tokenAddress);\n    uint bal = t.balanceOf(who);\n    return bal;\n}\n```\n\n6. The `withdraw()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `owner.transfer(etherBalance)` is used to transfer the contract's funds to the owner, but the `owner` is not updated until after the transfer is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `withdraw()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `owner` should be updated before the transfer is complete. Here is the modified `withdraw()` function:\n\n```\nfunction withdraw() onlyOwner public {\n    address myAddress = this;\n    uint256 etherBalance = myAddress.balance;\n    owner.transfer(etherBalance);\n}\n```\n\n7. The `burn()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `balances[msg.sender]` is used to check if the sender has enough tokens to burn, but the `totalSupply` is not updated until after the burn is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `burn()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `totalSupply` should be updated before the burn is complete. Here is the modified `burn()` function:\n\n```\nfunction burn(uint256 _value) onlyOwner public {\n    require(_value <= balances[msg.sender]);\n    address burner = msg.sender;\n    balances[burner] = balances[burner].sub(_value);\n    totalSupply = totalSupply.sub(_value);\n    totalDistributed = totalDistributed.sub(_value);\n    emit Burn(burner, _value);\n}\n```\n\n8. The `withdrawAltcoinTokens()` function in the `Primeo` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. The `token.transfer(owner, amount)` is used to transfer the contract's altcoin tokens to the owner, but the `owner` is not updated until after the transfer is complete. This allows an attacker to call the `withdrawAltcoinTokens()` function multiple times, causing a reentrancy attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds. To fix this vulnerability, the `owner` should be updated before the transfer is complete. Here is the modified `withdrawAltcoinTokens()` function:\n\n```\nfunction withdrawAltcoinTokens(address _tokenContract) onlyOwner public returns (bool) {\n    AltcoinToken token = AltcoinToken(_tokenContract);\n    uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));\n    return token.transfer(owner, amount);\n}\n```\n\n9.

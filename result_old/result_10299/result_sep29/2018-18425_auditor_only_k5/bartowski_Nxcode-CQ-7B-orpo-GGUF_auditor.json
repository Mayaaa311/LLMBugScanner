I have identified the following severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract:

1. Vulnerability: Integer overflow in SafeMath library
   Code:
   ```
   function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256 c) {
       if (a == 0) {
           return 0;
       }
       c = a * b;
       assert(c / a == b);
       return c;
   }
   ```
   Vulnerability: Integer overflow
   Reason: The function `mul` is vulnerable to an integer overflow due to its use of the `assert` statement. If the multiplication operation causes a overflow, it will fail the assertion and the multiplication operation will return 0.

2. Vulnerability: Integer overflow in Primeo contract
   Code:
   ```
   function getTokens() payable canDistr public {
       uint256 tokens = 0;
       require(msg.value >= minContribution);
       require(msg.value > 0);
       tokens = tokensPerEth.mul(msg.value) / 1 ether;
       address investor = msg.sender;
       if (tokens > 0) {
           distr(investor, tokens);
       }
       if (totalDistributed >= totalSupply) {
           distributionFinished = true;
       }
   }
   ```
   Vulnerability: Integer overflow
   Reason: The integer overflow vulnerability lies within the `getTokens` function. It uses the `mul` function from the SafeMath library to calculate tokens based on the incoming amount of Ether. This could cause an integer overflow if `tokensPerEth` and the incoming amount are extremely large.

3. Vulnerability: Improper token distribution in Primeo contract
   Code:
   ```
   function doAirdrop(address _participant, uint _amount) internal {
       require(_amount > 0);
       require(totalDistributed < totalSupply);
       balances[_participant] = balances[_participant].add(_amount);
       totalDistributed = totalDistributed.add(_amount);
       if (totalDistributed >= totalSupply) {
           distributionFinished = true;
       }
   }
   ```
   Vulnerability: Improper token distribution
   Reason: The function `doAirdrop` allows any amount of tokens to be distributed to a participant without verifying if they already own tokens. This could lead to the distribution of duplicate tokens and could cause a loss of funds.

4. Vulnerability: Incorrect balance retrieval in Primeo contract
   Code:
   ```
   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant public returns (uint256) {
       return balances[_owner];
   }
   ```
   Vulnerability: Incorrect balance retrieval
   Reason: The function `balanceOf` returns the balance of an owner but does not validate if the returned balance is accurate or the address exists within the contract. It could allow unauthorized access to the balance of any owner without any prior validation.

5. Vulnerability: Integer overflow in Approval function in Primeo contract
   Code:
   ```
   function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
       if (_value != 0 && allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0) { return false; }
       allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
       emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
       return true;
   }
   ```
   Vulnerability: Integer overflow
   Reason: The `approve` function allows users to set their allowance to be greater than the balance. This can cause an integer overflow if the amount being allowed is larger than the user's balance.

All identified vulnerabilities are considered severe and should be prioritized for a thorough review.

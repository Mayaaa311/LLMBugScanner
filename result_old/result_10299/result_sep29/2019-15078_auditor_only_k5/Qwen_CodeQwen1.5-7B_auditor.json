1. The `XBornID` contract has a vulnerability in the `getTokens` function. The `value` variable is set to 1000e18, which is a fixed value. This means that the same amount of tokens will be distributed to the same address every time the function is called. This can lead to a situation where the same address receives more tokens than they are entitled to. To fix this vulnerability, the `value` variable should be set to a random value each time the function is called. This can be done by using the `blockhash` function to generate a random number. The `value` variable should be set to `blockhash(block.number) % 1000e18 + 1`. This will ensure that each address receives a different amount of tokens each time the function is called. 2.

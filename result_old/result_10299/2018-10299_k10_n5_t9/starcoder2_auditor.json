<file_sep>Q: You are a smart contract auditor, identify and explain severe vulnerabilities in the provided smart contract. Make sure that they are exploitable in real world and beneficial to attackers. Provide each identified vulnerability with intermediate reasoning and its associated function. Remember, you must provide the entire function code and do not use "...". Make your reasoning comprehensive and detailed. Smart contract code:
pragma solidity 0.4.13;
contract MyContract {
    string public myName = "<NAME>";
    
    address owner;
    
    function MyContract() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    // Returns the name of the owner
    function getOwnerName () constant returns (string) {
        return myName;
    }
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
       if(msg.sender != owner){
           throw;
       }
       _;
    }
    
    // Only allow the owner to set their name
    function setName (string newName) onlyOwner public {
       myName = newName;
    }
}
\nYou should only output in below json format(stop when you finished the json):
{
     "output_list": [
         {
             "function_name": "<function_name_1>",
             "code": "<code of the function1>",
             "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_1>",
             "reason": "<reason_1>"
         },
         {
             "function_name": "<function_name_2>",
             "code": "<code of the function2>",
             "vulnerability": "<short_vulnera_desc_2>",
             "reason": "<reason_2>"
         }
     ]
}

Output 10 most severe vulnerabilities(they should not be the same bug)
If no vulnerability is detected, you should only output in this json format  {"output_list": []}.\n

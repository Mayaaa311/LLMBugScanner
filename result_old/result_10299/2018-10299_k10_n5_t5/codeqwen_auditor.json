However, there is no check in the `transferFrom` function to ensure that the sender has approved the transfer before calling it. This can lead to reentrancy attacks where an attacker can execute multiple transactions in a single block, causing them to lose their funds."

However, there is no check in the `transferFrom` function to ensure that the sender has approved the transfer before calling it. This can lead to approval phishing attacks where an attacker tricks the victim into approving a transfer for them, but not actually performing the transfer."

This oversight could lead to confusion and misuse of the allowance mechanism. The severity score should be high because it affects the functionality intended by the developer for interacting with external contracts.",

However, the reasoning should clarify that this issue directly compromises the integrity of the token balance and could be exploited in various attack scenarios.",

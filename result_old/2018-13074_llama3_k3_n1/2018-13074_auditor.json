These vulnerabilities are exploitable in real-world scenarios and beneficial to attackers. The first vulnerability allows for reentrancy attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly call the `_transfer` function to drain a contract's funds. The second vulnerability enables the transfer of tokens from one user to another without going through the normal transfer process, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks. The third vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the total supply and balance of a user's account by minting new tokens and emitting two transfer events with different recipient addresses.

Please note that these vulnerabilities are specific to this smart contract code and may not be applicable to other contracts.

The contract does check if the recipient's account is frozen or not (not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet). However, the function can still be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if there are other contracts that call this function repeatedly and drain the funds. Correctness score: 6/9. Severity score: 7/9.

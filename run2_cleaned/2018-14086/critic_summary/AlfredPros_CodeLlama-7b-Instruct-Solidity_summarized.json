It allows the sender to send tokens to another address, which can then call the transfer function again, leading to a recursive call. This can result in the sender's tokens being transferred to themselves, or even to a third party, causing a loss of funds. To mitigate this vulnerability, the transfer function should be modified to use the SafeMath library to prevent reentrancy attacks.",

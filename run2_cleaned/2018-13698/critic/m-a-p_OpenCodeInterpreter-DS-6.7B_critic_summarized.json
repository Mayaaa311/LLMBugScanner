}

In the above output, each function has been evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: The functions are implemented correctly according to the intended functionality. However, there is a potential for unauthorized minting, promotion value change, transfer, approval, and allowance checks.

- Severity: The vulnerabilities are severe as they can lead to unauthorized token manipulation and potential manipulation of the token supply.

- Profitability: The vulnerabilities are highly profitable as they can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the token supply.

Please note that the scoring is based on the severity and profitability of the vulnerabilities. The scoring ranges from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest).

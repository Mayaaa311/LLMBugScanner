}

In the above output, each vulnerability is evaluated based on three criteria: correctness, severity, and profitability. The scores range from 0 to 9, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. The criticisms provide detailed explanations for each vulnerability, including the reasoning behind the scores.

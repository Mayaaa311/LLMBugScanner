            "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
            "reason": "The function `safeMul` multiplies two numbers `a` and `b` and checks if the result `c` is equal to `a * b`. If `a` is 0, the assertion will pass. However, if `a` is not 0, the assertion will fail if `c / a` is not equal to `b`. This can lead to an integer overflow if `b` is very large. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to revert and prevent further transactions. The solution is to use a more secure multiplication function that can handle large numbers."

            "reason": "The function `safeDiv` divides two numbers `a` and `b` and checks if the result `c` is equal to `a / b`. If `b` is 0, the assertion will fail. This can lead to a division by zero error if `b` is 0. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to revert and prevent further transactions. The solution is to add a check to ensure that `b` is not 0 before performing the division."

            "reason": "The function `safeSub` subtracts two numbers `a` and `b` and checks if the result `a - b` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the assertion will fail. This can lead to an underflow error if `b` is greater than `a`. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to revert and prevent further transactions. The solution is to add a check to ensure that `b` is less than or equal to `a` before performing the subtraction."

            "reason": "The function `burn` subtracts `burnAmount` from the balance of the sender and updates the total supply. However, it does not check if the sender has enough balance to burn. If the sender does not have enough balance, the function will revert and prevent further transactions.

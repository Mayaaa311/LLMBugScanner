However, if `a` is not 0, the assertion will fail if `c / a` is not equal to `b`. This can lead to an integer overflow if `b` is very large. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to revert and prevent further transactions. The solution is to use a more secure multiplication function that can handle large numbers.",

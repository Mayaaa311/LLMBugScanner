In the analysis of the provided vulnerabilities, it is evident that the criticisms and scoring are based on the following criteria:

1. Correctness: The functions have been implemented correctly according to the intended functionality. However, there is a potential for the functions to be vulnerable to attacks if the sender's account is frozen.

2. Severity: The severity of the vulnerabilities is high, as they allow an attacker to freeze their own account and prevent them from transferring tokens to other accounts.

3. Profitability: The profitability of the vulnerabilities is moderate, as the potential for damage is limited to the attacker being able to freeze their own account.

Overall, the criticisms and scoring are based on the correctness, severity, and profitability of the vulnerabilities.

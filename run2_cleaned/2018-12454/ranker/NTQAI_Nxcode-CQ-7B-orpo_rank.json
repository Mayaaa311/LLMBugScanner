      "criticism": "The function setBettingCondition takes two parameters: _contenders and _bettingprice. The value of _contenders is assigned to arraysize, but there is no check to ensure that arraysize does not exceed 1000. This could lead to an integer overflow if _contenders is greater than 1000. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to cause the contract to spend more gas than necessary, leading to a loss of funds.",

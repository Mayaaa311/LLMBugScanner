      "criticism": "The function `getTokens` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. It allows users to send Ether to the contract and receive tokens in return. However, the contract does not check if the transfer of tokens to the user is successful before updating the totalDistributed variable. This can lead to a situation where the contract is in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails. To fix this vulnerability, the contract should use the SafeMath library to perform the addition and subtraction of tokens and the totalDistributed variable. Additionally, the contract should use the `transfer` function instead of `send` to transfer the tokens to the user. This will prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure that the contract's state is always consistent.",

            "vulnerability": "Unchecked ETH balance",
            "reason": "The function `distributeFUD` iterates through an array of addresses and transfers FUD tokens to each address if their ETH balance is greater than `_ethbal`. However, it does not check if the ETH balance is sufficient before transferring the tokens. This could lead to a reentrancy attack where the contract is called again during the transfer, potentially leading to loss of funds. This vulnerability is exploitable in real-world scenarios and beneficial to attackers."

However, it does not check if the caller is the contract owner. This could allow anyone to withdraw the tokens, potentially leading to loss of funds. This vulnerability is exploitable in real-world scenarios and beneficial to attackers."

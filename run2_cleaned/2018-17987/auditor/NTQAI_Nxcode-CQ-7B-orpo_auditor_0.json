This can lead to unexpected behavior and loss of funds if the sender's balance is insufficient or if the sender is a contract that reverts during the send operation. To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should be modified to use a non-reentrant modifier or to use a pull-payment pattern instead of a push-payment pattern."

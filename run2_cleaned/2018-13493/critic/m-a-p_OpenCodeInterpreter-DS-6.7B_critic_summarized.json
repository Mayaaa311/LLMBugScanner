Based on the given vulnerabilities and associated reasoning, here is the criticism for each function:

1. Function: TokenERC20
   - Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
   - Criticism: The function `TokenERC20` initializes the total supply of tokens with `initialSupply * 10**18`. If `initialSupply` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to mint more tokens than intended.
   - Correctness: 9
   - Severity: 9
   - Profitability: 9

2. Function: _transfer
   - Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
   - Criticism: The function `_transfer` subtracts `_value` from `balanceOf[_from]` and adds `_value` to `balanceOf[_to]`. If `_value` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to transfer more tokens than intended.
   - Correctness: 9
   - Severity: 9
   - Profitability: 9

3. Function: burn
   - Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
   - Criticism: The function `burn` subtracts `_value` from `balanceOf[msg.sender]` and subtracts `_value` from `totalSupply`. If `_value` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to burn more tokens than intended.
   - Correctness: 9
   - Severity: 9
   - Profitability: 9

4. Function: burnFrom
   - Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
   - Criticism: The function `burnFrom` subtracts `_value` from `balanceOf[_from]` and subtracts `_value` from `totalSupply`. If `_value` is too large, it may cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to burn more tokens than intended.
   - Correctness: 9
   - Severity: 9
   - Profitability: 9

5. Function: DaddyToken
   - Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
   - Criticism: The function `() payable public` calculates the number of tokens to be issued based on the amount of Ether sent and the current `buyTokenPerEther` price. If the amount of Ether sent is too large, it may cause an integer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker to issue more tokens than intended.
   - Correctness: 9
   - Severity: 9
   - Profitability: 9

In summary, the criticisms for each function are based on the potential vulnerabilities and associated reasoning. The correctness, severity, and profitability scores are set to the highest possible values (9) based on the severity of the vulnerabilities.

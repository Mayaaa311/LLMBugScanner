The 'assert' statement is used to check if the sum 'c' is greater than or equal to 'a'. If it is not, the program will revert and the transaction will fail. This ensures that the sum 'c' does not overflow the maximum value of an unsigned integer. However, if the sum 'c' is less than 'a', the program will still continue and the transaction will succeed, which is not the intended behavior. Therefore, the 'assert' statement is not sufficient to prevent integer overflow. A more robust solution would be to use a library that provides safe arithmetic operations, such as SafeMath.sol."

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
  "output_list": [
    {
      "function_name": "mintTokens",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function mintTokens is vulnerable to integer overflow. The addition of promoValue to balances[_investor] and totalSupply can cause an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256. This can be exploited by an attacker to mint an unauthorized amount of tokens.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "setPromo",
      "vulnerability": "Access Control",
      "criticism": "The function setPromo is vulnerable to access control. Only the owner of the contract can call this function, but it does not check if the new value is within a reasonable range. An attacker can use this function to set the promoValue to an extremely high value, which can lead to a loss of funds for the contract owner.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transfer",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function transfer is vulnerable to integer overflow. The subtraction of _amount from both balances[msg.sender] and balances[_to] can cause an overflow if the amount is greater than the current balance. This can be exploited by an attacker to transfer an unauthorized amount of tokens.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    },
    {
      "function_name": "transferFrom",
      "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
      "criticism": "The function transferFrom is vulnerable to integer overflow. The subtraction of _amount from both balances[_from] and allowed[_from][msg.sender] can cause an overflow if the amount is greater than the current balance. This can be exploited by an attacker to transfer an unauthorized amount of tokens.",
      "correctness": 7,
      "severity": 9,
      "profitability": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the output is already in JSON format and it contains all the vulnerabilities sorted by severity.

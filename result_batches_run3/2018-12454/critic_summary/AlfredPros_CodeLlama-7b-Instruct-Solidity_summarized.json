            "criticism": "The function setBettingCondition takes two parameters _contenders and _bettingprice. The value of arraysize is set to _contenders and bettingprice is set to _bettingprice. However, there is no check to ensure that the value of _contenders does not exceed 1000. This could lead to an integer overflow if _contenders is greater than 1000. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can set _contenders to a very large value, causing the arraysize to exceed 1000 and potentially leading to a loss of funds.",

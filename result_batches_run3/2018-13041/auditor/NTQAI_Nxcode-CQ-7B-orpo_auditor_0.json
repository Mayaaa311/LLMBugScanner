However, the addition of _value to balances[_spender] and totalSupply can lead to an integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable. This can be exploited by an attacker to mint an excessive amount of tokens, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the contract owner."

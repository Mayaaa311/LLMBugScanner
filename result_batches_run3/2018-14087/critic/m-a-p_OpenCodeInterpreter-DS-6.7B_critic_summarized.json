To mitigate this vulnerability, the division operation should be performed with a safe integer type that can handle large numbers, such as 'uint256'.",

However, the current implementation does not correctly transfer the purchased tokens to the buyer. The 'amount' variable is calculated as the result of dividing 'msg.value' by 'buyPrice', but the '_transfer' function is called with 'this' as the sender, which means the tokens are sent from the contract itself. This could lead to incorrect token allocation and potentially loss of funds for the buyer. To mitigate this vulnerability, the '_transfer' function should be called with 'msg.sender' as the sender, which means the tokens are sent from the buyer to the contract.",

To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should use a random number generator to determine the amount of tokens to be allocated to the buyer.

However, the current implementation does not enforce any access control. Anyone can call this function, which could potentially lead to the loss of funds for the contract owner. To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should be modified to only be callable by the contract owner.

Here is the extracted information formatted as a CSV:

```
dataname,vulnerability,function_name
2018-10299,Integer Overflow,batchTransfer
2018-10299,Integer Overflow,transfer
```

The CSV file has three columns: `dataname`, `vulnerability`, and `function_name`. Each row represents a unique combination of vulnerability and function name. The `dataname` value is `2018-10299` for both rows. The `vulnerability` value is `Integer Overflow` for both rows, and the `function_name` value is `batchTransfer` and `transfer` for the respective rows.
